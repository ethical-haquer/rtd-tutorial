Flashing Files
==============

Flashing files with Galaxy Flasher is easy. Here's how to do it:

Thor
----

* Click the "Connect" button. If there is more than one device connected, you will be prompted to select a device. You will know you have connected when the "Connect" button changes to "Disconnect".
* Once you're connected to a device, click the "Start Odin Protocol" button. If the button changes to "End Odin Protocol", you're good.
* Click the "Flash!" button. (after you have selected at least one file to flash)
* If the "[Thor] Automatically select all partitions" setting is off, you will be asked to select what partitions to flash from each file you selected. If that setting is on, Galaxy Flasher will automatically select all of the partitions for each file you selected.
* Once you (or the computer) have selected the partitions to flash from each file you selected, a "Verify Flash" window will appear. This is when you can abort if you didn't mean to flash what you selected. Click "No" to cancel, or "Yes" to begin flashing the device.
* That's it!

Odin4
-----

  Please note that unlike Thor, Odin4 does not have a "Verify Flash" window. If you accidentally started flashing your device, you can disconnect it from your computer when Odin4 is verifying the files. (verifying the files is the first thing it does, followed by flashing them) However, if Odin4 has already started flashing the files to your device, disconnecting your device may cause even more issues.

* Click the "Flash!" button. (after you have selected at least one file to flash)
* If there is more than one device connected, you will be prompted to select a device.
* That's it!
