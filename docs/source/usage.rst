Usage
=====

Galaxy Flasher's layout is similar to Odin.

In the upper-right there are four buttons: "Log", "Options", "Pit", and "Settings". Clicking these buttons will change what "tab" you are viewing. All four tabs are described `here <https://github.com/ethical-haquer/Galaxy-Flasher?tab=readme-ov-file#tabs>`_.

On the right side you will see five rows that each have a button and an entry. That is where you can `select files <https://github.com/ethical-haquer/Galaxy-Flasher?tab=readme-ov-file#selecting-files>`_.

For how to flash files, `look here <https://github.com/ethical-haquer/Galaxy-Flasher?tab=readme-ov-file#flashing-files>`_.

The entry above the file selection buttons/entries is the `Command Entry <https://github.com/ethical-haquer/Galaxy-Flasher?tab=readme-ov-file#command-entry>`_.
