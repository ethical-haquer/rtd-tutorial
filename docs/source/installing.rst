Installing
==========

There are currently two ways to install/use Galaxy Flasher:

* As a Flatpak
* As a .py file

:doc:`Installing as a Flatpak <flatpak-install>` is recommended for most users, as it supports a wider range of distros. The second way, :doc:`as a .py file <python-install>`, should be used if you are planning to contribute, or want native performance.
