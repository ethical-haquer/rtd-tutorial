As a .py file (currently not complete)
======================================

Prerequisites
-------------    
* Gtk4
* Adw 1
* Vte >= 0.72

Installation
------------

1. First of all, make sure you have the :ref:`above prerequisites <python-install:Prerequisites>`. Currently they are pretty vague; If you can't figure out what to install just let me know and I'll be glad to help!

2. Download the latest "galaxy-flasher-version-os.zip" file from `the Releases page <https://github.com/ethical-haquer/Galaxy-Flasher/releases/>`_. It is a good idea to make a new directory and save the file there, to keep it more contained.

3. Once the file is downloaded, extract it.

4. Move into the newly extracted directory. It should be named the same as the file, minus the ".zip" part.

5. Run this command::

    $ python3 galaxy-flasher.py

6. If Galaxy Flasher starts up, then you're done. Congratulations! If you instead get errors, **please let me know**. Thanks!
