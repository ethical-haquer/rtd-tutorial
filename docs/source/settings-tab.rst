Settings Tab
============

The Settings Tab is where you can change Galaxy Flasher's settings.
Here is a list of them:

* Flash Tool - The flash-tool you would like Galaxy Flasher to use. The options are:

  * Thor - An open-source flash-tool. The last update was almost a year ago, sadly.
  * Odin4 - A proprietary, official Samsung flash-tool that was leaked.
  * PyThor - An open-source flash-tool that is still in development. The only real reason to use it is if you plan on contributing to it.
   
You will have to restart Galaxy Flasher after changing this setting for it to apply.

* Theme - The theme you would like Galaxy Flasher to use. The options are:

  * System - Galaxy Flasher will attempt to use the system theme.
  * Light - Light theme.
  * Dark - Dark theme.

* Keep Log dark - Keeps the Log Tab dark, regardless of the theme.
    
* [Thor] Automatically select all partitions - This automatically selects all of the partitions from the files you select, instead of asking you what ones you would like to select. This only applies to Thor.
